# Linux Fundamentals: Read and Write Text Files
### In this file I have done commands related to file creation, reading and writing to the file using shell commands.
- `touch` : touch command is used to create file with the extension
  Example: `touch abc.txt` - creates files with .txt extension
- `echo`: used to displays the text 
- `tee`: Reads the input and writes it into output file 
- `tee -a`: -a is used to append the text to the given file
- `tail -n 10/ head -n`: Head and Tail is used to print the top n line form the top or bottom.
- `cat file-name` : cat command is used to print the text written inside the file.
